# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Overview

This project is part of the Titanic Kaggle competition, where the goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. The dataset provides information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, and family relationships to help make predictions.

## Dataset Information

- `PassengerId` → Unique ID for each passenger

- `Pclass` → Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)

- `Name` → Passenger’s name

- `Sex` → Gender (male/female)

- `Age` → Passenger's age in years

- `SibSp` → Number of siblings/spouses aboard

- `Parch` → Number of parents/children aboard

- `Ticket` → Ticket number

- `Fare` → Price paid for the ticket

- `Cabin` → Cabin number

- `Embarked` → Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

- `Survived` → Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

## Approach

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Feature Engineering (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature selection)

- Model Selection & Training

  - Logistic Regression

  - Random Forest Classifier

  - Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

- Hyperparameter Tuning

- Final Model Evaluation & Kaggle Submission

## Future Improvements

- Future Improvements
